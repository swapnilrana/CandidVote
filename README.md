# ECE651-CandidVote

ECE651 Project. A voting system using blockchain, that solves the major redundancies of any legacy voting system and can be extended for any general voting needs. 

In any electoral event, the security threat that is possessed by a general voting system is huge. Any tampering with the process of casting votes can result in catastrophic results that may lead to a corrupted outcome. So, it is the right of every voter to make sure that no tampering or illegal modifications are done to the votes that they have casted. 
 
This is not possible with a regular client server-based e-voting system, where remote hacking and bad authority interference is a huge threat and cannot be avoided.  
 
Hence, we propose a block-chain based voting system where once a poll is received it can neither be removed nor be modified. It also reduces the painstaking counting process of regular old pen and paper-based voting system as the ballot counting is live and immediate. Looking at the security and transparency in the proposed CandidVoTe system, it can also be further extended to any high-level professional voting needs.  <br>
<br> We are plan to achieve the above-mentioned features through: <br>
 
•	Authenticating the voter using block chain, hence only valid voters are allowed to cast a vote and no temperament of votes are done using unauthorized voters. <br>
•	Casting the voter’s vote into a distributed ledger (Ethereum block chain) so that the votes after being casted cannot be modified nor removed from the system. <br>
•	Creation of an admin panel to initiate and facilitate an entire election process. <br>
 
By implementing this project, we will learn innovative technologies like Solidity, Ethereum based Smart contacts, Ganache, Truffle and MEAN stack tools and framework like Nodejs, express, Mongo-DB, Bootstrap etc.  
We are aiming to utilize the best and well adopted software practices to implement this project by following Agile, and using technologies like GitLab, Kanban to facilitate the implementation.
